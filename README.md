# Project Name: Bill Lens
## 1. Purpose:
   **Bill Lens** is an automated expense tracking application designed to streamline personal finance management. By leveraging machine learning, optical character recognition (OCR), and geospatial technology, Bill Lens eliminates manual data entry. It allows users to digitize receipts instantly, visualize their spending habits through interactive analytics, and track the physical locations of their expenses on an interactive map.
## 2. Main Functionalities:
   - **Smart Receipt Scanning:** The core feature allows users to capture photos of physical receipts. Using on-device machine learning (ML Kit), the app automatically extracts crucial information—specifically the total cost, transaction date, and merchant location—without manual typing.
   - **Interactive Expense Mapping:** Users can visualize their spending footprint geographically. The app integrates the Google Maps SDK to display expense locations with markers. To achieve this, the mobile app directly queries the Geokeo API to convert the extracted address text into precise geographic coordinates (geocoding), ensuring accurate placement on the map without burdening the backend server.
   - **Automated Cloud Storage:** Once scanned, expense data is securely transmitted to a backend system as soon as the connection is possible , in the meanwhile the data is stored locally on the device following an offline-first architecture. The receipt metadata is indexed in a relational database (PostgreSQL) for reliable long-term storage and retrieval.
   - **Client-Side Data Visualization:** The app provides rich insights into spending habits by rendering custom graphs and statistics charts directly on the device. Using Android's native 2D graphics libraries (Canvas API), the app processes raw financial data retrieved from the server to draw smooth, responsive visualizations without waiting for server-side image generation.
   - **Automated Spreadsheet Export:** To facilitate external reporting, users can export their expense history directly to Google Sheets. This feature is orchestrated by the backend server, which utilizes the Google Sheets API and Google Drive API to format the data and create a spreadsheet in the user's personal Drive.
   - **Secure Authentication:** To ensure data privacy and synchronization, users authenticate securely via Google Sign-In (powered by Firebase Authentication), ensuring that expense records are tied to a unique, verified identity.
## 3. Application Architecture:
   The system is built using a modern, scalable tech stack distributed across mobile, backend, and cloud services:
   - **Android Client:** Built with Jetpack Compose for UI and CameraX for image capture. It utilizes ML Kit for text recognition and the Google Maps SDK for location visualization. The app handles heavy lifting on the client side: it communicates directly with the Geokeo API for coordinates and utilizes Android 2D Graphics (Canvas) to render statistical charts locally. Hilt manages dependency injection, while Coroutines/Retrofit handle asynchronous data fetching.
   - **Backend API:** A lightweight Flask server acts as a pure REST API. Its primary responsibility is managing CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for expense data, acting as the interface between the mobile app and the database without handling UI logic or image generation.
   - **Database:** PostgreSQL is used for structured data persistence.
   - **Cloud & External Services:** Firebase SDK manages authentication, Google Cloud Platform (GCP) underpins the ecosystem also for the Google Sheets and Drive APIs, and Geokeo is utilized as a third-party service for client-side address geocoding.
